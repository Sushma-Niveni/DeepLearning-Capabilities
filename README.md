# DeepLearning-Capabilities
# Introduction
This project explores various deep learning techniques, including softmax function properties, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on CIFAR-10, generative adversarial networks (GANs) on Fashion-MNIST, and innovative uses of ChatGPT-4.
# Objective: Demonstrate practical applications and theoretical understanding of deep learning concepts.

# Softmax Properties:
Mathematical Proof: Show the invariance of the softmax function to constant offsets. Explain why adding a constant to the input does not affect the output probabilities.
Practical Importance: Discussed the significance of this invariance in neural network implementation, focusing on numerical stability and training efficiency.
Empirical Part
CNN on CIFAR-10:

# Data Exploration: 
Load and visualize the CIFAR-10 dataset to understand its structure and sample images.
# Model Training: 
Implement a CNN with three convolutional layers, using ReLU activation, max pooling, and global average pooling. Train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate its performance. Plot training loss and accuracy.
# Filter Visualization:
Visualize the learned 11x11 filters from the first convolutional layer. Normalize and arrange these filters in a grid format for better understanding.
# Batch Normalization: 
Enhance the CNN model with batch normalization layers. Compare the performance and training loss with and without batch normalization.
# GAN on Fashion-MNIST:

# Vanilla GAN:
Build and train a basic GAN consisting of a Generator and a Discriminator. Use Fashion-MNIST to generate images and evaluate the GANâ€™s performance by plotting training losses and visualizing generated samples at different stages of training.
# Mode Collapse:
Modified the Discriminator to classify images into 10 categories. Train it on Fashion-MNIST and use it to classify samples generated by the GAN. Analyze and plot the distribution of generated sample labels to identify mode collapse issues. Discuss the effectiveness of techniques to address mode collapse.
